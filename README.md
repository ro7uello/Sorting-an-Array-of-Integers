# Sorting-an-Array-of-Integers using Bubble Sort

This open-source repository contains a C program that demonstrates the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The Bubble Sort algorithm is a simple comparison-based sorting technique that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is completely sorted.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sorting-an-Array-of-Integers.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Sorting-an-Array-of-Integers
   ```

3. Compile the C program using any C compiler of your choice. For example:

   ```
   gcc -o sort sort.c
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```
   ./sort
   ```

   You will be prompted to enter the size of the array and the elements of the array.

5. The program will then sort the array using the Bubble Sort algorithm and display the sorted array.
